      When a current-carrying conductor is placed in a transverse magnetic field, a potential difference is developed across the conductor in a direction perpendicular to both the current and the magnetic field. This phenomenon is called the <strong>Hall effect</strong>. It determines both the type and concentration of charge carriers in the given semiconductor sample.

      Carrier density refers to the number of free charge carriers (electrons in n-type or holes in p-type semiconductors) per unit volume of the material. It can be calculated once the Hall coefficient (R<sub>H</sub>) is known using the relation:
    </p>

    <div style="text-align:center;margin:1.2em 0;font-style:italic">

      Carrier mobility is a measure of how quickly a charge carrier (electron or hole) can move through a semiconductor when subjected to an electric field. It reflects the ease with which carriers can drift and directly affects the material’s conductivity and response time in electronic devices.

    Optical fibers are waveguides that transmit light through total internal reflection. The attenuation (loss) in optical fibers is a measure of the decrease in optical power as light travels through the fiber, typically expressed in decibels per kilometer (dB/km).

The attenuation coefficient (α) is given by:
</p>
<p class="formula">

α = (10/L) × log₁₀(Pin/Pout)

- α is the attenuation coefficient in dB/km<br>
- L is the fiber length in km<br>
- Pin is the input optical power<br>
